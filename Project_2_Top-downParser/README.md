PROJECT 2: Top-down Parser

Compiler Design: Top-down Parser in C++
By An Nguyen, Anh Nguyen, Gia Ly, Timothy Vu

Instructions on how to run it:

First, you need to install either Vscode or Visual Studio on your machine if you haven't done so. After installation, you may need tou update your Vscode environment variable (e.g, MinGW and PATH) so that you can invoke c++ command line. If you use an IDE such as Visual Studio, configure your IDE so that it can find your C++ installation and use its libraries.

Depending on whether you use command line or an IDE, follow one of the below two instructions to get the sample compiled and run:

1. If you use command line
To compile in command line, navigate to your src file then compile and run

cd path/path/....../path //enter your directory
g++ File_Name //to compile
./a.exe or ./a.out //to run the code

2. If you use Visual Studio IDE
In the Visual Studio IDE, create a project and import the code. Then use the below steps to build and run:
(1) Click the "Local Windows Debugger"
(2) Click "Debug -> Start Debugging"
(3) Shortcut: press "F5" or "ctrl+F5"
