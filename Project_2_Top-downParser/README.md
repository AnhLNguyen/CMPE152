PROJECT 2: Top-down Parser

Compiler Design: Top-down Parser in Java
By Anh Nguyen (leader), Gia Ly, Timothy Vu, and An Nguyen

Instructions on how to run it:

First, you need to install either Vscode or Visual Studio on your machine if you haven't done so. After installation, we recommend you use the **Coding Pack for Java**, which is the bundle of VS Code, the Java Development Kit (JDK), and a collection of suggestion extensions by Microsoft. The Coding Pack can be downloaded on the following URL: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java

Make sure you check your Java version and Javac version before compile the program.

Depending on whether you use command line or an IDE, follow one of the below two instructions to get the sample compiled and run:

1.  If you use command line in VS Code
    To compile in command line, navigate to your main.Main file then compile with the following commands:

         // To navigate the path to your main
         cd path/path/....../path //enter your directory
         // To compile the program
         javac symbols/*.java
         javac inter/*.java
         javac lexer/*.java
         javac parser/*.java
         javac main/Main.java

    To run this program in command line:

         java main.Main
         // Input your text in one line
         // For example:
         // {int r; int dd; int a; int d;r = a; dd = d;while( dd <= r ) dd = 2*dd;}

2.  If you use Visual Studio IDE
